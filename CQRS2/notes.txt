Commands
  - syntax: "name"[, arg]...
  - sent to a specific object
    - gets translated by the library into a method call
      - the method is a void public instance method and called asynchronously (the caller doesn't wait for it to finish)
      - if the method cannot be found, the library looks for a NotImplemented method with a void NotImplemented(params object[] args) signature
      - if neither can be found, the library throws an exception at the caller site

Events
  - syntax: "name"[, arg]...
  - sent globally
