Commands
  - syntax: "name"[, arg]...
  - sent to a specific object
    - gets translated by the library into a method call
      - the method is a void public instance method and called asynchronously (the caller doesn't wait for it to finish)
      - if the method cannot be found, the library looks for a NotImplemented method with a void MethodMissing(string name, params object[] args) signature
      - if neither can be found, the library throws an exception at the caller site

Events
  - syntax: "name"[, arg]...
  - sent globally
    - objects have to register their interest in event names
    - the registrations return IDisposable objects that can be used for de-registration

MethodCaller
  - used to do the actual calling (common code for both commands and events)
  - exposes an UnhandledException event that gets raised if the called method throws
