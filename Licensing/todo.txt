x add a LicenseValidator class and move LicenseRegistration.IsValidLicense to it.
x move the UpdateRemainingRuns call outside the IsTrial method
x make constructor and Initialize protected
x add a /strike/LicenserFactory/strike/ Bootstrapper (might conflict with the above)
x add a NullEncryptor (instead of passing null / property injection)
x add a NullRemoteChecker
x add a parameter in the HMACValidator constructor with the options password
x every time the license is confirmed, set CreatedOn to today, Limit.Runs to -1 and Limit.Days to 30
  - alternative: use the HMAC-verified license and just not care about verification anymore
- add acceptance tests for the common scenarios
