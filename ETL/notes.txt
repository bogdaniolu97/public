ETL.Library - library for importing / processing / exporting data
===========

Generates code (or assembly) for all three steps, based on text (later UI) specifications.

Start with single record type, fixed size, with fixed size fields.

Future: add support for parallel processing.

Error handling - based on option:
- Throw.
- Log the record index (and possibly the field index) and the error and skip.
- Custom processing (call user-specified callback; make the callback return true to retry the operation).
