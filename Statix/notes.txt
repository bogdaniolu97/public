- basic language, Markdown or something like it
- the command-line tool generates the HTML/CSS files, probably based on a template
- at some point in the future, only files that have been modified should be reprocessed

- features:
  - for each input file:
	- read the markdown
	- transform the markdown content into an HTML content
	- write the HTML
	- write any additional files required (like images)
  - write the common CSS
