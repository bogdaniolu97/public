x Replace the Account with an accountId in Message


Message should have an Account, there should be an AccountMapper used by TwitterChannel that knows to convert between TwitterAccount and Account




- TwitterChannel might need refactoring, there is a lot of embedded business logic

- TwitterChannel.Send is not working:
  - It needs the "in reply to" id / name
  - Sending the whole thing leads to "msg7" ->
    "I do not know what [@ElomenBot msg7] means" ->
    "I do not know what [I do not know what [@ElomenBot msg7] means.] means." -> ...
  ! Need to ensure that I'm not spamming others, so do NOT send / process a message that does not start with "@ElomenBot" or that
    has any other "@" sign except for the first one


- Write a Twitter client
- All times should be UTC; confirmations should be similar to "I will notify you at 03:35 UTC (08:35 local) to ...".
  - The account should have settings for time format (12 or 24 hours) and date format
