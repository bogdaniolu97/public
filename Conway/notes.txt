Conway's Game of Life

Game rules:
- a board that can either be considered infinite, or limited to a MxN size
- each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead
- on each round, the program computes the next state for each cell:
  - a live cell with less than two neighbours dies
  - a live cell with more than three neighbours dies
  - a dead cell with exactly three neighbours becomes alive
  - in any other case, the cell stays the same
  - neighbours are counted diagonally, so a cell in the middle of the board has eight neighbours
  - for a limited board, cells beyond the edge are considered permanently dead (they cannot become alive even if they have exactly three neighbours)

Code rules:
- a method has at most three lines
- no ifs; use either type-based polymorphism or lookup tables
- no primitive arguments / results except for constructors; this includes lists, arrays or enumerables
  - no more than three arguments, including to constructors
- a class that contains a collection cannot contain any other member variables
