Basic abilities: STA (stamina), STR (strength), AGI (agility), INT (intelligence)
STA - determines max energy (STA x 50) and max HP (STA x 10)
      - gets used by running (1 / sec) and can be used for special attacks, depending on the weapon
      - if current HP < max HP, every 30 seconds current HP grows with STA; this is the default health recharge rate
      - same with energy (EP)
STR - requirement for armor and weapons; influences damage
      - OE, overextended, x 0.75 if STR < 0.75 x armor / weapon requirement
      - OP, overpowered, x 1.5 if STR > 1.5 x armor / weapon requirement
AGI - determines run speed (AGI x 10) and influences evade (chance of avoiding attacks)
INT - determines mana pool (INT x 10); requirement for spells
      - if current MP < max MP, every 30 seconds current MP grows with INT; this is the default mana recharge rate

Derived stats:
- max energy: STA x 50
- max HP: STA x 10
- move speed: AGI x 10
- attack rating: STR x 5 (together with the opponent's evade stat, determines the chance of a hit, miss or critical)
- evade: AGI x 5 (influences the chance of avoiding incoming hits)

Four types of damage / armor: air, earth, fire, water

Slots:
- head (armor)
- body (armor)
- right arm (armor)
- left arm (armor)
- right hand (one- or two-hand weapon)
- left hand (one-hand weapon / shield)
- legs (armor)
- feet (armor)
- eight implant slots, one for each body part, that can give bonuses
  - can be implanted anywhere (don't need a special device)
  - once used, implants have to be destroyed to free the slot

Weapons:
- damage range: min to max
- actual damage on each hit calculated as a random value in the [min, max] interval
- modified by the OE / OP factors, if one is in effect
- further modified by implants, if any of them have +DMG modifiers
- incoming damage is further modified by the total armor of the opponent: dmg = round (dmg x (1 - (armor / (armor + 100))))
  - examples: armor 0 means full damage (no reduction)
  - armor 1 means incoming damage is ~99%
  - armor 10 means incoming damage is ~90%
  - armor 100 means incoming damage is halved
  - armor 1000 means incoming damage is ~10%

The only damage being checked is the one matching the effective damage type (which is weapon damage unless overriden by spells or items). In other words, if an air
attack hits someone with 100 earth armor but zero air armor, the zero value matters (so the full damage is applied).
