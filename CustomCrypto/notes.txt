Idea based on Heidi Lamar's invention

- generate an unsigned, 31-bit int based on the key
- use that number as a seed for the C# Random(); call the instance rng

- for each bit in the message:
  - generate 32-bit random numbers (cryptographically secure)
  - when encrypting: set the (rng.Next() % 32) bit to the message bit value
  - when decrypting: get the (rng.Next() % 32) bit as the message bit value
